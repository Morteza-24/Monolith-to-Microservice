# Current Status

- [x] implementing `A Hierarchical DBSCAN Method for Extracting Microservices from Monolithic Applications`

- [x] implementing evaluation measures to test the the _Hierarchical DBSCAN Method_ on some _Test_Projects_

- [x] implementing `MICROscope` Method; using CodeBERT and fuzzy c-means clustering

- [ ] implementing evaluation measures to test the the _MICROscope Method_ on some _Test_Projects_


# How to Use

## MICROscope
1. Make sure you have Java installed and the `java` command is available.
2. Make sure that `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `scikit-fuzzy`, `pytorch`, and `transformers` are installed:
```
python -m pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-fuzzy torch transformers
```
3. Run:
```
python MICROscope.py --help
```

## Hierarchical_DBSCAN
1. Make sure you have Java installed and the `java` command is available.
2. Make sure that `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `nltk` are installed:
```
python -m pip install numpy scikit-learn nltk
```
3. Run:
```
python hierarchical_DBSCAN.py --help
```
